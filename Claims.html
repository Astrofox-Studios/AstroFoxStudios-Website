            <h1>Official Statement from Astrofox Studios</h1>
        </div>
    
        <div class="section-title">
            <h2>Setting the Record Straight</h2>
        </div>
    
        <div class="section-text">
            <p>Recently, false accusations have been made against Astrofox Studios and its leadership, spreading misinformation that misrepresents our team, our decisions, and our work environment. We believe in full transparency and want to address each claim directly, providing proof where necessary to ensure that the truth is clear.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="section-title">
            <h2>Claim 1: Astrofox's Leadership is Abusive and Unfair</h2>
        </div>
    
        <div class="section-text">
            <p><strong>Reality:</strong> These accusations lack substantiation. We have evidence that contradicts the claims made in the original Twitter thread.</p>
            <img src="/images/image-122.png" alt="AstroFox Studios" class="image">
            <img src="/images/image-116.png" alt="AstroFox Studios" class="image">
            <img src="/images/IMG_7556.png" alt="AstroFox Studios" class="image">
            <p>Our leadership team has always operated with fairness and transparency. Staff members are encouraged to share their opinions, and major decisions are made with community input. The suggestion that staff are "silenced" or "mistreated" is not supported by evidence.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="section-title">
            <h2>Claim 2: Astrofox Manipulated the Poll to Keep Individual 1 Out</h2>
        </div>
    
        <div class="section-text">
            <p><strong>Reality:</strong> The poll regarding a former staff member's potential return was conducted fairly, and the result was overwhelmingly against their return. <strong>Eighty-five percent (85%) of staff voted against this individual rejoining Astrofox.</strong> The decision was based on the collective preference of the team.</p>
            <img src="/images/image-140.png" alt="AstroFox Studios" class="image">
            <p>This former staff member's past behavior contributed to several staff members choosing to leave the team, which factored into the team's decision.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="section-title">
            <h2>Claim 3: Astrofox is a Toxic Work Environment</h2>
        </div>
    
        <div class="section-text">
            <p><strong>Reality:</strong> We have documentation indicating that certain former team members created challenging working conditions. This includes evidence of conduct that led to staff departures and previous professional separations.</p>
            <img src="/images/Screenshot from 2025-03-06 19-54-39.png" alt="AstroFox Studios" class="image">
            <img src="/images/Screenshot from 2025-03-06 19-56-34.png" alt="AstroFox Studios" class="image">
            <img src="/images/Screenshot from 2025-03-06 19-58-17.png" alt="AstroFox Studios" class="image">
    
            <p>These screenshots demonstrate concerning patterns of behavior. Astrofox prioritizes a <strong>collaborative and respectful work environment.</strong> Many current staff members have openly supported our leadership and can confirm that these claims of toxicity are not representative of our workplace culture.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="section-title">
            <h2>Claim 4: Testers Were Mistreated and Ignored</h2>
        </div>
    
        <div class="section-text">
            <p><strong>Reality:</strong> Testers were never verbally abused or diminished. If concerns about treatment were raised, we addressed them directly with the relevant parties. Feedback is crucial to our development process, and all reports are reviewed. During a specific phase of testing, testers were asked to focus primarily on lag issues as this was our highest priority at the time.</p>
            <p>The claim that testers were criticized for reporting bugs is not accurate. Several testers continue to work with us and have not reported mistreatment.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="section-title">
            <h2>Claim 5: Server Performance Issues Were Ignored</h2>
        </div>
    
        <div class="section-text">
            <p><strong>Reality:</strong> Server performance is a top priority. While some past events faced temporary performance issues, they were due to legacy code and unexpected load, not negligence. We have since optimized our infrastructure and continue working on improvements.</p>
            <p>Performance reports are actively reviewed after every event, and staff feedback is always considered. ExpHost has nothing to do with this lag, It is all code based.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="section-title">
            <h2>Claim 6: People Were Wrongfully Removed from Astrofox</h2>
        </div>
    
        <div class="section-text">
            <p><strong>Reality:</strong> Staff transitions have always been based on professional considerations including behavior, work performance, or team dynamics. <strong>We maintain a professional environment where decisions are made to benefit the overall team.</strong></p>
            <p>The evidence indicates that Astrofox operates with professionalism and integrity.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="section-title">
            <h2>Claim 7: NDA Controversy</h2>
        </div>
    
        <div class="section-text">
            <p><strong>Reality:</strong> NDAs are standard for team members with access to sensitive information in accordance with our data protection policies that align with GDPR requirements. All staff are free to choose whether or not to sign.</p>
            <p>Confidentiality agreements are in place to protect intellectual property and personal data. Any personnel actions taken are based on adherence to agreed-upon terms, not on refusal to sign agreements.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="section-title">
            <h2>Claim 8: Business Practices and Professionalism</h2>
        </div>
    
        <div class="section-text">
            <p><strong>Reality:</strong> Astrofox Studios is a real company that follows professional standards. Running high-quality events requires structured management, clear policies, and confidentiality agreements. The fact that we take our work seriously is not a valid criticism.</p>
            <p>Those critical of our organizational structure typically have different expectations about how such organizations should operate.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="section-title">
            <h2>Claim 9: Astrofox is Untrustworthy and Should Be Shut Down</h2>
        </div>
    
        <div class="section-text">
            <p><strong>Reality:</strong> Astrofox has <strong>successfully run multiple events, built a strong community, and provided a positive space for both players and staff.</strong> Our track record demonstrates our commitment to our community.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="section-title">
            <h2>Additional Claims: NDA Controversy and Workplace Conduct</h2>
        </div>
    
        <div class="section-text">
            <p><strong>Reality:</strong> The allegations regarding NDAs and inappropriate conduct require clarification:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>NDAs:</strong> Confidentiality agreements are implemented for team members with access to sensitive information and company assets, in accordance with data protection requirements. These agreements are legally binding when properly executed by competent parties. Personnel actions are taken based on adherence to agreed-upon terms.</li>
                <li><strong>Workplace Conduct:</strong> The incident referenced was not initiated by Astrofox leadership. We have taken steps to address this internally and ensure such behavior is not tolerated.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    
        <div class="section-title">
            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        </div>
    
        <div class="section-text">
            <p>The facts indicate that many of these accusations stem from misunderstandings or mischaracterizations. <strong>The evidence we've presented</strong> demonstrates that decisions made by our leadership were fair, transparent, and supported by the team.</p>
            <p>We remain committed to maintaining a positive environment for our community and staff. We encourage anyone with questions to review the information we've provided and reach out directly with any concerns.</p>
